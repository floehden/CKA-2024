# [Day 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDOoB4k4YSs&t=795s) - What Is DNS ( Domain Name System) 

The Day30 Video of the #40daysofKubernetes Challenge is about DNS.
And DNS server is there to translate a domain to an IP address like for example www.google.com to 172.217.18.4
```
nslookup www.google.com

Server:         10.255.255.254
Address:        10.255.255.254#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   www.google.com
Address: 172.217.18.4
Name:   www.google.com
Address: 2a00:1450:4001:810::2004
```

Why do we need a DNS or an extra name?
Mostly because we can't remember the IP of a service, so we address it by an alias, a name, that we can remember like [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) or [thecloudopscommunity](https://thecloudopscommunity.org/).
Also IP addresses of services can change. With the name we don't need to remember the new IP address and 

There are 13 [Root DNS Servers](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers) out there which lead to more DNS servers in the backend. 
Of course there are also multiple other DNS Server, like the [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) on 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 or look [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) to find the IPv6 addresses. Also Cloudflare has a public DNS server on [1.1.1.1](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/).
\\
For translating the addresses to IPs we have multiple different records(there are more, but these are the basics)
* The A Record translates a subdomain to a IPv4 address like the www in www.google.com. @ routes the domain to the IP address
* The AAAA Record translates a subdomain to a IPv6 address like the www in www.google.com.
* The CNAME redirects a subdomain to another domain. That domain also has a DNS Record which points to another IP via A(AAA) Record or domain via CNAME Record
* The MX is a mail exchange record, which points to a mailserver
* The TXT record is basically a human readable text
* The NS Record points to a Nameserver, so like all the subdomains for abc.xyz are manged by that nameserver. Like

DNS server are not only in the internet, but also there is the hosts file in Linux systems 
```
cat /etc/hosts

# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
# [network]
# generateHosts = false
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       <computer-name>.    <computer-name>

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

At the resolv.conf file you can enter which DNS you wanna use
```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Or we can also ask different DNS by using 
```
nslookup siticom.online 8.8.8.8

Server:         8.8.8.8
Address:        8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   google.com
Address: 142.250.185.110
Name:   google.com
Address: 2a00:1450:4001:80f::200e
```
