# CKA Course 2024

Currently I'm doing the CKA Course with the help of Piyush Sachdeva from Tech Tutorials with Piyush
It is a [#40DayChallenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_gMoe7Ik8k&list=PLl4APkPHzsUUOkOv3i62UidrLmSB8DcGC) and for each day there are several [tasks](https://github.com/piyushsachdeva/CKA-2024/tree/main).
This repository is my space where I'm doing and saving these tasks.
